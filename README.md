# dcl-pixel-canvas-api
 Forked DCL pixel canvas, added tetris cube structures elevators, and color picker following the player.
 Needs game of life generative system to be implemented for more interesting interactions.

 - Canvas API needs collection to be made with *posX*, *posY* and *hexColor* fields
Used https://restdb.io/ for that
