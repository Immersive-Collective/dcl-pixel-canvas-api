# dcl-pixel-canvas-api
 Forked DCL pixel canvas, added tetris cube structures elevators, and color picker following the player.
 Aim is to add game of life generative system for interactions, elevator system and audio.

 - Canvas API needs a collection to be made with *posX*, *posY* and *hexColor* fields
Used https://restdb.io/ for that
